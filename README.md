# Bayesian Air Traffic Modeling

Welcome aboard BayesAir, a Bayesian framework for modeling and analyzing air transportation network dynamics! ðŸ›«âœ¨

This repository contains a Bayesian model of air traffic network dynamics implemented as a probabilistic program in [Pyro](pyro.ai).

It also provides our algorithm, CalNF, for learning generative models in data-constrained settings.

This code accompanies our ICLR 2025 paper, [Rare event modeling with self-regularized normalizing flows: what can we learn from a single failure?
](https://openreview.net/forum?id=gQoBw7sGAu). If you use this code, please cite
